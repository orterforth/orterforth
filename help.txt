BUILDING ORTERFORTH
===================

To build orterforth for the local system (Linux, macOS, 
Cygwin), call:

 make

To build a version implemented in assembly, for performance,
call:

 make clean
 make SYSTEMOPTION=assembly

The target executable is built at the location:

 <os>-<arch>/orterforth.exe (on Cygwin)
 <os>-<arch>/orterforth     (on others)

where <os>   is e.g.: cygwin, darwin, linux
      <arch> is e.g.: aarch64, armv6l, armv7l, i686, x86_64

To run the local system build call:

 make run


BUILDING FOR RETRO PLATFORMS
============================

To build orterforth for a another platform, such as a retro
machine or microcontroller, you will need prerequisites such 
as some of the following:

* a C toolchain for the platform,
* system ROM files in the roms directory,
* system emulator source files,
* an installed emulator,
* a physical machine.

For details of what is needed to build and run on specific
targets, run:

 make help TARGET=<target>

where <target> is one of:

  bbc
  pico
  rc2014
  ql
  spectrum
