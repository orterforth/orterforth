BUILDING ORTERFORTH
===================

To build orterforth for the local system (Cygwin, Linux, macOS,
Windows), call:

 make

(NB on Windows you will need to use a Native Tools Command
Prompt. The file make.bat invokes NMAKE.)

To build a version implemented in assembly, for performance,
call:

 make clean                     ( to remove the default build )
 make OPTION=assembly

(Not currently implemented on Windows.)

The target executable is built at the location:

 <os>-<arch>/orterforth.exe (on Cygwin, Windows)
 <os>-<arch>/orterforth     (on others)

where <os>   is e.g.: cygwin, darwin, linux, windows
      <arch> is e.g.: aarch64, armv6l, i686, x86_64

To run the local system build call:

 make run

BUILDING FOR RETRO PLATFORMS
============================

To build orterforth for a another platform, such as a retro
machine or microcontroller, you will need prerequisites such 
as some of the following:

* a C toolchain for the platform,
* system ROM files in the roms directory,
* system emulator source files,
* an installed emulator,
* a physical machine.

For details of what is needed to build and run on specific
targets, run:

 make help TARGET=<target>

where <target> is one of:

  amiga
  bbc
  c64
  dragon
  m100
  pico
  ql
  rc2014
  spectrum
  z88

(These retro builds are not currently implemented on Windows.)
