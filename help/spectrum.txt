Building for the ZX Spectrum 48K
================================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* Fuse emulator http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net
* Interface 1 ROM file (place in roms/spectrum )
* Z80 emulator https://github.com/superzazu/z80

To build, call:

 make TARGET=spectrum (to build using superzazu's emulator)
 make TARGET=spectrum SPECTRUMIMPL=fuse (to build in Fuse)

The target files will be built in the respective named 
directory, e.g.:

 spectrum/orterforth.bin (the pure binary)
 spectrum/orterforth.ser (with Interface 1 serial header for 
                         loading over RS-232 or ZX Net) 
 spectrum/orterforth.tap (TAP file with loader)

To run in Fuse, call:

 make run TARGET=spectrum

To load and run on a physical machine, connect the Interface 1
to your host system via RS-232 and call:

 make spectrum-load-serial
