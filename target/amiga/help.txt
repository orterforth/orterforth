Building for the Commodore Amiga
================================

You will need:

* vbcc      http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html
* Amiga NDK - see:
  https://linuxjedi.co.uk/using-vbcc-as-an-amiga-cross-compiler-in-linux/
* FS-UAE    https://fs-uae.net/ 
* Kickstart ROM
* Workbench floppy image .adf file
* xdftool   https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools

To build, call:

 make TARGET=amiga                   (using FS-UAE)
 make TARGET=amiga AMIGAMACHINE=real (on a physical
                                     machine connected via
                                     serial port)

The target files will be built in the respective named 
directory, e.g.:

 amiga/orterforth     (the Amiga executable)
 amiga/orterforth.adf (the disk image)
 amiga/orterforth.bin (the relocatable installation)

To run in FS-UAE, call:

 make run TARGET=amiga
