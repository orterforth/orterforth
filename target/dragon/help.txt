Building for the Dragon 64
==========================

You will need:

* CMOC    http://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/cmoc.html
* LWTOOLS http://www.lwtools.ca
* XRoar emulator with a modification to support serial 
  emulation over two named pipes (currently a private code
  change) http://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/
* Dragon 64 ROM files

To build, call:

 make TARGET=dragon OPTION=assembly (6809 assembler)
 make TARGET=dragon OPTION=default (default C build)

Target files built at:

 dragon/orterforth.bin
 dragon/orterforth.cas
 dragon/orterforth.wav

To run in XRoar, call:

 make run TARGET=dragon

Currently there doesn't seem to be working support for Dragon
64 serial port in Mame. XRoar does not provide it and a crude
modification was made to the source to implement it for this
purpose.

The resulting binary can be loaded on a Dragon 32, obviously
without serial support.
