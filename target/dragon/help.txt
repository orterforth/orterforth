Building for the Dragon 32/64
=============================

You will need:

* CMOC    http://sarrazip.com/dev/cmoc.html
* LWTOOLS http://www.lwtools.ca
* XRoar emulator with a modification to support serial 
  emulation over two named pipes (currently a private code
  change) http://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/
* Dragon 32 or 64 ROM files

To build on a physical machine, call:

 make TARGET=dragon OPTION=assembly (6809 assembly)
                    OPTION=default  (C)
                    DRAGONMODEL=dragon32 (uses TRS-80 Deluxe
                     RS-232 Program Pak for serial, which is
                     compatible although the accompanying ROM
                     is not)
                    DRAGONMODEL=dragon64 (uses Dragon 64
                     serial)

Target files built at:

 dragon/orterforth.bin
 dragon/orterforth.cas
 dragon/orterforth.wav

To load and run, call:

 make run TARGET=dragon DRAGONMACHINE=mame
                        DRAGONMACHINE=real
                        DRAGONMACHINE=xroar

Currently there doesn't seem to be working support for Dragon
64 serial port in MAME. XRoar does not provide it and a crude
modification was made to the source to implement it for this
purpose.

The resulting binary can be loaded on a Dragon 32, obviously
without serial support.

The binary is fully relocatable, with position-independent code
and relocatable install, creating a single binary that can be
loaded beyond graphics pages. ORIGIN moves dynamically but
LIMIT, FIRST, USER, R0, S0, TIB remain the same in high RAM.

For example, load with:

 make run TARGET=dragon DRAGONOFFSET=1800

to load at 0x0600 + 0x1800 = 0x1E00, i.e., above graphics page
4, to make use of graphics modes.
