Building for the Sinclair QL
============================

You will need:

* xtc68 https://github.com/stronnag/xtc68
* C68 runtime binary distribution
        http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/c/index.html
* There is no emulator build so you need a Sinclair QL
  (unexpanded)
* sQLux emulator https://github.com/SinclairQL/sQLux
* a SER2 serial cable to connect to the host system.

To install and run on sQLux, call:

 make run TARGET=ql OPTION=assembly (for m68k assembly version)
 make run TARGET=ql OPTION=default  (for C)

To install and run on a physical machine, connect to your host
system via RS-232 and call:

 make run TARGET=ql QLMACHINE=real

Follow the instructions to load the installer. When install is
complete, you will need to reset the QL and follow further
instructions to load the final build.

QL orterforth is installed in resident procedure space, but
the code itself is run as a job. The job starts by relinking 
code fields to the correct memory addresses in the job.
