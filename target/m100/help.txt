Building for the Tandy TRS-80 Model 100
=======================================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* Serial port and physical machine

To build, call:

 make TARGET=m100

The target files are:

 m100/orterforth.co  (a .CO file)
 m100/orterforth.ser (for loading with loader.ba)

To load and run, call:

 make run TARGET=m100

Note: memory is tight on the 24K Model 100 and orterforth.co is
too large to both save as a RAM file and also load at the
execution address.
