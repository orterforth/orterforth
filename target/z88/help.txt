Building for the Cambridge Z88
==============================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* Expanded Cambridge Z88 with serial adapter

To build, call:

 make TARGET=z88

Follow the instructions to import via Imp-Export and run in BBC
Basic.

The target files will be built in the respective named 
directory, e.g.:

 z88/orterforth.bin (BBC Basic target)
 z88/orterforth.imp (in Imp-Export escaped format)

To load the resulting file, call:

 make z88-install

and again follow instructions. From then on you will be able
to:

 RUN "orterforth"

directly from BBC Basic.
