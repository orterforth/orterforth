Building for the RC2014
=======================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* hexload.bas, from https://github.com/RC2014Z80/RC2014
* Physical RC2014 with BASIC ROM
* FTDI serial connection

To build, call:

 make TARGET=rc2014 RC2014OPTION=default  (default C impl)
 make TARGET=rc2014 RC2014OPTION=assembly (assembly optimised impl)

and follow instructions. You may need to reset the RC2014 so it
responds to serial input, however a script then takes care of
resetting memory top.

The target files are:

 rc2014/orterforth     (the pure binary)
 rc2014/orterforth.ihx (Intel HEX format, for hexload.bas)
 rc2014/orterforth.ser (hexload.bas and the .ihx file bundled
                       together)

To run, call:

 make run TARGET=rc2014

The disc executable provides both disc and console access:

 <system>/disc mux <serial-port> 115200 <dr0> <dr1>

with disc I/O bytes flagged with bit 7 set. (Console I/O bytes
will have bit 7 clear, and so the command:

 <system>/orter serial <serial-port> 115200 <dr0> <dr1>

will also work, but there will be no disc access.)
