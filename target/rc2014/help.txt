Building for the RC2014
=======================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* hexload.bas, from https://github.com/RC2014Z80/RC2014
* Physical RC2014 with BASIC ROM
* FTDI serial connection

To build, call:

 make TARGET=rc2014 RC2014OPTION=default  (default C impl)
 make TARGET=rc2014 RC2014OPTION=assembly (assembly optimised impl)

and follow instructions. You may need to reset the RC2014 so it
responds to serial input, however a script then takes care of
resetting memory top.

The target files are:

 rc2014/orterforth     (the pure binary)
 rc2014/orterforth.ihx (Intel HEX format, for hexload.bas)
 rc2014/orterforth.ser (hexload.bas and the .ihx file bundled
                       together)


To run, call:

 make run TARGET=rc2014
