Building for the Raspberry Pi Pico
==================================

You will need:

 * CMake                       : https://cmake.org/
 * Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.1.0 :
   https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
   and its dependencies (Makefile expects PICO_SDK_PATH to be
   located at: ~/.pico-sdk/sdk/2.1.0)

To build, call:

 make TARGET=pico                 (for default C version)
 make TARGET=pico OPTION=assembly (for asm version)

Target file is:
