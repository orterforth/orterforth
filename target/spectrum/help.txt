Building for the ZX Spectrum 48K
================================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* Fuse emulator http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net
* Interface 1 ROM file (place in roms/spectrum )
* Z80 emulator https://github.com/superzazu/z80

To build, call:

 make TARGET=spectrum (to build using superzazu's emulator)
 make TARGET=spectrum SPECTRUMIMPL=fuse (to build in Fuse)

The target files will be built in the respective named 
directory, e.g.:

 spectrum/orterforth.bin (the pure binary)
 spectrum/orterforth.ser (with Interface 1 serial header for 
                         loading over RS-232 or ZX Net) 
 spectrum/orterforth.tap (TAP file with loader)

To run in Fuse, call:

 make run TARGET=spectrum

Type LOAD "" in Fuse to load the installer and the final build.
Note that since the phantom typist was introduced, Fuse auto
start does not appear to work.

To load and run on a physical machine, connect the Interface 1
to your host system via RS-232 and call:

 make run TARGET=spectrum SPECTRUMMACHINE=real
