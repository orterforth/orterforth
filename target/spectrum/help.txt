Building for the ZX Spectrum 48K
================================

You will need:

* z88dk https://z88dk.org/
* 48K ROM file at ./48k.rom and roms/spectrum/spectrum.rom
* Interface 1 ROM file at ./if1-2.rom and
  roms/spectrum/if1-2.rom
* Fuse emulator http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net
* Z80 emulator https://github.com/superzazu/z80

To build, call:

 make TARGET=spectrum (to build using superzazu's emulator)
 make TARGET=spectrum SPECTRUMINSTMACHINE=fuse
                      (to build in Fuse)

The target files will be built in the respective named 
directory, e.g.:

 spectrum/orterforth.bin (the pure binary)
 spectrum/orterforth.ser (with Interface 1 serial header for 
                         loading over RS-232 or ZX Net) 
 spectrum/orterforth.tap (TAP file with loader)

To run in Fuse, call:

 make run TARGET=spectrum

Note that Fuse requires the ROM files supplied with the exact
names "48k.rom" and "if1-2.rom" in the root directory,
otherwise it regards them as custom ROMs and auto start is
disabled.

To load and run on a physical machine, connect the Interface 1
to your host system via RS-232 and call:

 make run TARGET=spectrum SPECTRUMMACHINE=real
